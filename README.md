### Rules
- White always starts
- <b>Turn-based</b>: Each player can move one figure within his turn
- <b>Eliminate figure</b>: Get on the same square as your opponents figure
- <b>Check</b>: Each time your figures display a threat to your opponents king it is called check. Your opponent has to move his king away from the threat.
#### Game endings
- <b>Checkmate</b>: If your opponent can't move his king away from the threat, it is called checkmate. With checkmate the game is over and you've won. 
- <b>Draw</b>: If your opponent has only the king left but can't move it because all squares nearby are a threat, it is a draw. 
#### Special
- <b>Promotion</b>: If a Pawn reaches the opposite side of the board, it can be promoted to any piece
- <b>En Passant</b>: If a Pawn's first move of two spaces lands it directly next to an opponent's Pawn, the opponent has the option of capturing the Pawn as it passes. If it chooses to capture, the opposing Pawn advances diagonally as it would have if the first Pawn had initially moved only one space. If the opponent chooses not to capture on the turn immediately after the two-square jump, s/he cannot capture afterward, even if the pawn hasn't moved forward
- <b>Castling</b>: This can be done on the Rook's and the King's first move only. If no other pieces are in between them or could potentially move between them, the King is moved two spaces closer to the Rook. The Rook is then placed on the opposite side of the King. The King cannot be in check or pass through check when performing this move.
